# DiceGame
This is DiceGame small game for two. 
Rules are simple : First you input the winning score, and the first player will roll the dice, 
if he/she gets number 1 it will reset the current score and the turn will go to another player, 
otherwise the numbers will be added. If you press "Hold", the scores from "current scores" tab will be permanent, but it will be other player's turn. 
The winner is the person who gets winning score(or more) first.
